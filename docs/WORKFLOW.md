# AI development workflow

## Project file roles

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Durable instructions the coding agent loads automatically |
| `CLAUDE.md` | An `@AGENTS.md` import, because Claude Code ignores `AGENTS.md` |
| `SPEC.md` | Product and technical requirements and acceptance criteria |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Ordered outcomes, dependencies, risks, and exit criteria |
| `TASKS.md` | Current actionable work and validated status |
| `PLAN.md` | How the change in flight is being implemented, and why |
| `.agents/skills/` | Reusable workflows Codex can invoke |
| `docs/` | Reference material loaded only when requested or linked |

## Complete lifecycle

1. Install this repository's global instructions, configuration, rules, and
   reusable skills. Use `$adopt-baseline` once per repository to standardise an
   existing project on these conventions.
2. Inspect the real repository, branch, worktree, architecture, runtime paths,
   and existing validation.
3. Put durable project conventions and boundaries in `AGENTS.md`.
4. Define observable requirements, non-goals, and acceptance criteria in
   `SPEC.md`.
5. Order outcomes, risks, exit criteria, and validation in `ROADMAP.md`.
6. Break the current phase into reviewable work in `TASKS.md`.
7. Use `$ai-project-manager` to produce a requirement-linked plan with automated
   and manual validation, and record the chosen approach in `PLAN.md`.
8. Stop for plan approval when the user reserved that checkpoint.
9. Implement one approved phase, run focused checks, and inspect the diff.
10. Run the complete local gate and update task status only after it passes.
11. Use `$pr-readiness` to inspect the final diff, confirm the local gate, and
    check merge readiness.
12. Fix actionable findings, rerun validation, and repeat until clean or every
    remaining item has a documented reason.
13. Commit the focused change, push it, and open a draft pull request only when
    authorized.
14. Require CI validation, applicable security checks, and a fresh independent
    review on the latest commit.
15. Fix or explain every review item, resolve completed threads, and repeat the
    checks after every push.
16. Complete and document required manual testing on the real target
    environment.
17. Merge only after the final diff, planning documents, CI, security checks,
    reviews, threads, and manual tests are clean.

## Security baseline

Establish the security checks that apply to the repository instead of adding
irrelevant gates:

- Enable secret scanning and push protection where available.
- Configure Dependabot for every package ecosystem and GitHub Actions.
- Run dependency review when dependency manifests can change.
- Configure CodeQL for every language in the repository that CodeQL supports.
- Document accepted exceptions with a reason, owner, and review date.

## Required pull request evidence

Record the problem, approach, important decisions, exact automated checks,
manual tests, screenshots for visible changes, limitations, skipped validation,
and follow-up work.

## Documentation rule

Do not rely on a coding agent discovering arbitrary documents by filename.
Reference supporting documents from `AGENTS.md`, a selected skill, or the task
prompt. Keep the specification, roadmap, tasks, and implementation synchronized
when requirements or architecture change.
