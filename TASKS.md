# AI tasks

## Completed phase: Workflow alignment

- [x] Add project planning documents and reusable planning templates.
- [x] Add a focused pull-request readiness skill.
- [x] Add isolated Linux, macOS, and Windows installer integration tests.
- [x] Add pull-request CI, dependency review, Dependabot, and a PR template.
- [x] Align Claude routing and workflow documentation.
- [x] Add opt-in, cross-platform installation for selected Codex plugins.
- [x] Trust all Git worktrees beneath the current user's `~/github` directory.
- [x] Run local repository, shell, installer, workflow, and skill validation.
- [x] Confirm Windows installer integration, including plugin installation and
  recursive GitHub trust generation, passes in CI.
- [x] Inspect the final diff and stage only workflow-alignment changes.

## Current phase: Claude and Codex parity

- [x] Rename `codex-home/` to `ai-home/` and split shared and per-agent files.
- [x] Link the shared instruction file to both agents' global instruction paths.
- [x] Link every skill into `~/.claude/skills/` as well as `~/.agents/skills/`.
- [x] Derive Claude permissions from `default.rules` and merge them safely.
- [x] Reduce `CLAUDE.md` to `@AGENTS.md` and move the RTK catalog to `docs/RTK.md`.
- [x] Update the specification, roadmap, layout, and skill documentation.
- [x] Rename PowerShell functions to approved verbs and singular nouns, and add
  PSScriptAnalyzer to local validation and CI.
- [x] Add a `PLAN.md` convention, template, and documentation routing.
- [x] Add the `powershell-scripting` and `windows-sysadmin` skills.
- [x] Make skill descriptions agent-neutral and separate the host and fleet
  sysadmin triggers.
- [x] Add the `adopt-baseline` skill for standardising existing repositories.
- [x] Add the `web-development` skill and drop product-specific skills from the
  default set.
- [x] Prune stale managed skill links on every install.
- [x] Install the Superpowers plugin into Claude Code as well as Codex, adding
  its marketplace first because Claude Code registers none until first use.
- [x] Skip a missing agent's plugins with a warning instead of failing the run.
- [x] Run repository, shell, installer, and skill validation locally.
- [ ] Confirm the Windows installer integration test passes in CI.
- [ ] Inspect the final diff and stage only parity changes.

## Next phase: Enforced repository governance

- [ ] Configure a default-branch ruleset after CI check names exist remotely.
- [ ] Require pull requests, successful validation, and conversation resolution.
- [ ] Require an independent approval when repository ownership permits it.

## Completion rule

Move current-phase tasks to completed only after their acceptance criteria and
required validation pass. Keep external GitHub settings pending until verified
through the live repository.
